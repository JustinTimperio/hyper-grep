## Notes
- 27/10/19 | So far I have tested the Hyperscan API using simplegrep.c and have seen some pretty impressive performace gains. Initally I wasn't sure the gain would be +35% but it seems to be about +200% to +500% faster.
- 28/10/19 | Still having issues understanding how the C API works along with the how the python-hyperscan CFFI works.
