# hyper-grep _Under Development_

This project is an attempt to use the [Hyperscan](https://intel.github.io/hyperscan/dev-reference/) C API to perform regex searches. 
This is a sister project of [Hyper-Genome](https://github.com/JustinTimperio/hyper-genome) which aims to accelerate the speed of genome searches by using modern advancements in DPI regex libraries.
